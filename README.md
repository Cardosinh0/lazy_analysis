# Lazy Analysis ðŸ’¤ðŸ“Š
Exploring automation in data analysis reporting

This repository is part of my personal portfolio and showcases a template that automates report generation from Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb). The goal is to eliminate the need for manually creating presentations, allowing analyses to be easily updated by simply running the notebook again â€“ and, if needed, integrated into automated pipelines with tools like Apache Airflow.

Objective:
- Simplify the generation and updating of data analysis reports
- Remove the need for manual PowerPoint creation
- Explore automation in the data science workflow

This project reflects my approach to making data analysis more efficient and scalable. ðŸš€
